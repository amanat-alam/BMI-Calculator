        <h2>How Your BMI is Calculated</h2>
        <p>Your Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated using a simple formula that takes into account your weight and height. The formula is BMI = kg/m², where kg is your weight in kilograms and m² is your height in meters squared. This calculation provides a numerical value that can be used to categorize your weight status and assess potential health risks.</p>

        <!-- Health Tips Section -->
        <h2>Health Tips According to BMI Range</h2>
        <p>Here are some health tips based on your BMI range:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Underweight (BMI &lt; 18.5):</strong> Focus on gaining weight through a balanced diet rich in nutrients. Include more calories from healthy foods like nuts, seeds, and lean proteins. Consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.</li>
            <li><strong>Normal weight (BMI 18.5 - 24.9):</strong> Maintain your weight through a balanced diet and regular physical activity. Continue to monitor your BMI to ensure it remains within the healthy range.</li>
            <li><strong>Overweight (BMI 25 - 29.9):</strong> Aim to lose weight through a combination of healthy eating and increased physical activity. Focus on portion control, reducing sugar and fat intake, and incorporating more fruits and vegetables into your diet.</li>
            <li><strong>Obese (BMI ≥ 30):</strong> Work towards significant weight loss to reduce health risks. Seek guidance from a healthcare provider or a dietitian to create a sustainable weight loss plan. Incorporate regular exercise and make long-term dietary changes.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- BMI Understanding Section -->
        <h2>Understanding BMI</h2>
        <p>The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple calculation using a person's height and weight. The formula is BMI = kg/m² where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m² is their height in meters squared. A BMI of 25.0 or more is overweight, while the healthy range is 18.5 to 24.9. BMI applies to most adults 18-65 years.</p>
